üìú Script: Change.py

üéØ Purpose:
    - This script allows an admin to audit and modify a user's repository permissions within a GitHub organization.
    - Specifically, it lists all repos where the user has access and downgrades their permissions to read-only ("pull").

üîß Input:
    - GitHub username (entered interactively)
    - GitHub access token stored in a `.env` file (GH_TOKEN)
    - Organization  stored in a `.env` file  (ORG_NAME)

üì§ Output:
    - Console log showing:
        ‚Ä¢ Repos the user has access to
        ‚Ä¢ Their current permission level
        ‚Ä¢ Confirmation of permission downgrade to "pull"
        ‚Ä¢ Final verification of updated access

üìù Notes:
    - Requires `PyGithub` and `python-dotenv`
    - Token must have: `admin:org`, `repo`, `read:org` scopes
    - Must be run by a user with admin rights in the organization
